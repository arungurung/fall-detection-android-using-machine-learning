# Technology-in-healthcare-for-fall-detection-of-patients_s4598724_VU
Research project on the topic "technology in healthcare for fall detection of patients" by Arun Gurung (student id: 4598724) at VU, 2019.

TensorFlow is used in the project for machine learning. LSTM model was created and used for the model. Jupyter notebook can be found in <a href="https://github.com/arungurung/Technology-in-healthcare-for-fall-detection-of-patients_s4598724_VU/tree/master/Processing%202" target="_blank">Processing 2</a>. 

The model was exported and imported to a simple android application. If fall is detected, it prompts the user with 10 seconds of warning to confirm if it was a fall. If no response is taken, the configured SMS number would be sent an SMS informing about the person's fall.
