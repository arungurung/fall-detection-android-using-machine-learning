Research project on the topic "technology in healthcare for fall detection of patients" by Arun Gurung (student id: 4598724) at VU, 2019.

Previous submissions are in its own separate branch. There is a different branch for documents used in literature review.

Branching towards Machine Learning by using the accelerometer on the mobile device using TensorFlow models. Might not use AWS SageMaker. And then TensorFlow Lite for android for the final application if possible.
